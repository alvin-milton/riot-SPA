=============

[riotJS](http://riotjs.com/http://riotjs.com/) is pretty amaze

Why? Because minimalism.

**features**

- Router
- ReactJS-like syntax w/o JSX 
- No proprietary event handling (bleh)
- Small footprint as compared to AngularJS, ReactJS (12.5KB minified)
- Syntax is a pleasure to write, way cleaner than ReactJS
- Virtual Dom
- LifeCycle events on component
- Tags can be rendered server-side
- Can use any preprocessor (Coffeescript, ES6, etc)
- Faster to parse, cheaper to download as far as payload
- Vanilla JS!!!
